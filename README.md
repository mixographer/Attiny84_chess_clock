# Attiny84 Chess Clock
A chess clock based on the Atmel Attiny84 micorcontroller.

This project is a simple chess clock based on the Atmel Attiny84 micoprocessor. It uses the SCD55104 LED Display 
module to display player times and user interface menus. The time periods are adjustable and the clock operated 
in three different modes. 

# Modes
## Sudden Death
In Sudden-death mode, your clock runs when it is your turn, and you lose when you run out of time. 

## Fischer Delay
In Fischer Delay mode, an increment is added at the start of each turn. In Fischer Increment mode you can actually 
add time to your total if you move faster than the increment amount. 

## Hourglass
In Hourglass mode, as one player's time goes down, the other player's time goes up.
