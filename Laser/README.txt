This SVG file (box_final_3mm_revised.svg) can be used as an enclosure for the Chess Clock. The original file box_final_3mm.svg had some errors in the side panels. Do not use that file.

I had enclosures cut from these files at Pololu.com. 

Note: I have not had this exact file laser cut. I have revised it to include the mounting holes 
on the front face. I have printed the drawings and compared them to the basic board 'scd55104_chess_clock.brd' They look good, but double check them if you are going to send them off to be cut. 

I have also not made an enclosure for 'Chess_Clock_Larger.brd' as of yet.
